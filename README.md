This site was created in conjunction with the udemy training course https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/ which walk you through the steps involved to be active and conversant with React.

This project based course me you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer in 2023. We will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is a full stack app (MERN stack), using Google's Firebase.

The curriculum is very hands on as it walks you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects.

The project I have built is avalable on the url: https://calm-khapse-0668a0.netlify.app/
